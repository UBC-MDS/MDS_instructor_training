### Work particularly well for coding

1. **Code & Run** - learner asked to write code that produces a specified output

1. **Inverting Code & Run** - learners asked to write tests to determine whether a piece of code conforms to a spec

1. **Fill in the Blanks** - learner is given some starter code and has to complete it so that the code produces a specified output 

1. **Parsons Problem** - learners given lines of code that need to be rearranged to generate a specified output

1. **Tracing** 
    - execution: given a few lines of code, the learner has to trace the order in which those lines are executed
    - values: given a few lines of code, the learner lists the values that one or more variables take on as the program runs

1. **Minimal Fix** - given a few lines of code that contain a bug, the learner must find it and make one small change to fix it 

1. **Refactoring** - given a working piece of code, the learner has to modify it in some way without changing its output

### Works well for memorization & conceptual questions (can also be used for coding)

1. **Multiple choice questions** - learners asked to choose the correct answer (works best with relevant distractors present)

1. **Diagrams** - provide them with a diagram and a set of labels and have them put the latter in the right places on the former

1. **Matching** - learner is asked to match labels in one column with text in another
